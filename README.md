#### Ubiquitous - Project 6, Android Nanodegree Course, Udacity
This application provides a custom watchface for round and square watches with weather updates

This project has been modified to add support to werable devices by providing watchface which shows weather updates.

Main focus was how to implement watches for square and round watches and communication from mobile app to watchface to update weather

Few things I learnt/ implemented in this project:

* Implementing Google APi Client to communicate between mobile app and wearable device.
* Implementing WearableListenerService to accept messages (not included in this project) 
* Creating interface for round and square watches
* Using canvas to draw various artifacts
